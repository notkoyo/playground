## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to:

- Test out new programming languages.
- Experiment with different frameworks and libraries.
- Prototype and validate new ideas.
- Practice coding and improve my skills.

## Contents
You'll find various folders and files, each named to reflect the specific language or technology being tested. Examples include:

- go/ - Snippets and projects written in Golang.
- typescript/ - Code snippets and applications using TypeScript.

## Usage
Feel free to browse through the code and use any snippets or ideas that might be helpful for your own projects. However, please note that this code is primarily for personal experimentation and may not always follow best practices or be production-ready.
